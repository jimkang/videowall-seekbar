videowall-seekbar
==================

A very simple browser UI control for use with [Babelify]() that coordinates seeking in multiple videos.

It handles:

- Providing you with a seekbar DOM element.
- Updating the seekbar to reflect the position of the videos' playback. It does this via a `style` tag on its DOM element.
- Updating the videos' `currentTime` when the seekbar handle is moved.
- Notifying you (if you subscribe to its `usersetvalue` event) when the value changes as a result of UI action.

It leaves to you:

- Adding the seekbar DOM element however and whenever you see fit.
- Styling the seekbar via CSS.


Installation
------------

    npm install videowall-seekbar

Instantiation
-------------

    var Seekbar = require('videowall-seekbar');

    var seekbar = Seekbar({
      mediaElements: arrayOMediaDOMElements,
      min: 0,
      max: 100,
      init: 0
    });

The Seekbar factory opts are:

  â€“ `mediaElements`: An array of HTMLMediaElements. This could be video or audio. In fact, they don't strictly have to be HTMLMediaElements. They just have to be objects that implement [currentTime](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/currentTime), addEventListener, and emit `timeupdate` events. See tests for details.
  - `min`: This is the minimum possible value for the seekbar and videos.
  - `max`: This is the maximum possible value for the seekbar and videos.
  - `init`: This is the initial value for the seekbar.

Usage
-----

    var seekbarDOMElement = seekbar.el();
    parentDOMElement.appendChild(seekbarDOMElement);

    seekbarDOMElement.addEventListener('usersetvalue', logValue);

    function logValue(e) {
      console.log(e.target.getValue);
    }

Seekbar instances have the following methods:

  - `el`: Returns the seekbar's DOM element.
  - `getValue`: Returns' the seekbar's current value.

Seekbar instances emit a `usersetvalue` event whenever the user changes the value via the UI.

Building
--------

If you know how to use Babelify, you know how to build with this module. Browserify is a tool that lets you organize your code as Node modules and then build it so that the browser understands it. Babelify is a *transform* for Browserify that converts ES6 code into ES5 code so that current browsers understand it. So, your build command will be something like:

    browserify your-main-file.js -t babelify

In development, you probably want to use a watcher like [wzrd](https://github.com/maxogden/wzrd). So, your command will be something like:

    wzrd index.js -- -t babelify

Then, wzrd will say something like:

    server started at http://localhost:9966

And you can open your browser to that and hopefully see your seekbar!

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
